				<p>The remake of Footloose arrives in theaters tomorrow, with Kenny Wormald taking over for Kevin Bacon as Ren McCormack. (The original: not as fun as you remember.) The 27-year old Wormald has been a professional dancer since he was a kid, growing up in Stoughton, Massachusetts, just outside of Boston. Last night, we caught up with him at the Footloose premiere after-party at the Tribeca Grand Hotel, and spoke with him about his dancing, his Boston accent, and his willingness to protect his co-star - and Ryan Seacrest's girlfriend - Julianne Hough from creeps.</p>

			<h2>Give more haalp...</h2>

				<p>How did you get ready for the big angry dance scene in Footloose? You just think about anyone that's ever pissed you off your whole life and take it out on them.</p>

			<article>
				<p>Did you have a double? As far as the dancing goes? None. I did all of the dancing. The gymnastics flip on the pole, I can't take credit for that. But I mean, great editing. </p>

			<article class="last">
				<p>Is there a time when dancing should be outlawed? There is a time. Around Julianne Hough, if you're a creep. I can handle it... she, not so much.</p>
